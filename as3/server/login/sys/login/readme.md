Action `login`
=============

__Action name__ : `login`

__Action description__ : `Login request`

There are two files in this section - PrimaryLogin and WorldLogin. 

* __Primary Login__ is the first login attempt you make before getting into the game. 
* __World Login__ is the final login attempt you make to get into and play the game.

This is is the only `action`, for which the server responds with a __XT__ Packet instead of XML.
